# Module Variables

This package adds the necessary complexity to reason and handle the changes introduced by:
[\[pysrc2cpg\] Model Field-like Behaviour of Module Variables](https://github.com/joernio/joern/pull/3750/)

There is likely a much better schema-level way of addressing this hybrid behaviour of module-level variables, but this 
is the least intrusive and does not require some larger amount of planning. Thus, we leave the following note:

TODO: Replace with a far-reaching, but simpler solution across frontends.
