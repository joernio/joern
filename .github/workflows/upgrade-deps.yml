name: upgrade-deps
# Nightly job that verifies that we can upgrade all internal dependencies
# This essentially runs `./updateDependencies.sh --non-interactive` and
# runs the regular tests, to notify us if some upstream dependency
# introduced breaking changes. If it's red, that's not the end of the
# world, but we should get it back on track to unblock others.
