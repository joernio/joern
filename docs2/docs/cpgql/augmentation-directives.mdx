title: Augmentation Directives
---

Augmentation Directives are CPGQL Directives which extend a Code Property Graph with nodes, properties and edges.

Take the following simple program named `X42`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  if (argc > 1 && strcmp(argv[1], "42") == 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "It depends!\n");
    exit(42);
  }
  printf("What is the meaning of life?\n");
  exit(0);
}
```


### newTagNode

`newTagNode` is an _Augmentation Directive_ that adds tags with user-defined keys to the nodes that are part of the traversal they're suffixing. It works together with the `store` CPGQL Component which creates the actual nodes representing the tags, and the `run.commit` [Top-Level Command](/joern/top-level-commands) which merges those nodes in the active _Code Property Graph_.

Say for example that you'd like to add tags to all the nodes of `X42`'s Code Property Graph that represent calls to `exit`. That is, these two:

```java
// list all CALL nodes in the X42 program with the string "exit" in their CALL property
joern> cpg.call.name("exit").code.l 
res0: List[String] = List("exit(0)", "exit(42)")
```
And say that you'd like to use the key `MY_KIND_OF_EXIT` for the tags you want to create:

```java
// create tags with the key MY_KIND_OF_EXIT for all CALL nodes which have the string "exit" in the value of their NAME property
joern> cpg.call.name("exit").newTagNode("MY_KIND_OF_EXIT").store 

// apply the diffgraph to the currently active Code Property Graph
joern> run.commit 
2020-07-02 14:07:02.041 [main] INFO Enhancement io.shiftleft.console.Commit$$anon$1 completed in 0 milliseconds
The graph has been modified. You may want to use the `save` command to persist changes to disk.  All changes will also be saved collectively on exit
res1: Cpg = io.shiftleft.codepropertygraph.Cpg@97c920b

// list the newly created tags
joern> cpg.tag.name("MY_KIND_OF_EXIT").l 
res2: List[nodes.Tag] = List(
  Tag(id -> 42L, name -> "MY_KIND_OF_EXIT", value -> ""),
  Tag(id -> 41L, name -> "MY_KIND_OF_EXIT", value -> "")
)

// list the CODE property of all CALL nodes attached to the newly created tags
joern> cpg.tag.name("MY_KIND_OF_EXIT").call.code.l 
res3: List[String] = List("exit(42)", "exit(0)")
```

### newTagNodePair

`newTagNodePair` is very similar to `newTagNode`: it is an _Augmentation Directive_ that adds tags with user-defined keys and user-defined values to the nodes that are part of the traversal they're suffixing. It also works together with `store` and `run.commit`, but you can specify both a key and a value for the nodes created:


```java
joern> cpg.call.name("exit").newTagNodePai("MY_OTHER_KIND_OF_EXIT", "MY_VALUE").store 

joern> run.commit 
2020-07-02 14:07:02.041 [main] INFO Enhancement io.shiftleft.console.Commit$$anon$1 completed in 0 milliseconds
The graph has been modified. You may want to use the `save` command to persist changes to disk.  All changes will also be saved collectively on exit
res1: Cpg = io.shiftleft.codepropertygraph.Cpg@97c920b

joern> cpg.tag.name("MY_OTHER_KIND_OF_EXIT").l 
res2: List[nodes.Tag] = List(
  Tag(id -> 44L, name -> "MY_OTHER_KIND_OF_EXIT", value -> "MY_VALUE"),
  Tag(id -> 43L, name -> "MY_OTHER_KIND_OF_EXIT", value -> "MY_VALUE")
)

joern> cpg.tag.value("MY_VALUE").call.code.l 
res3: List[String] = List("exit(42)", "exit(0)")
```
