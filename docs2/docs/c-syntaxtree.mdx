In this article, we introduce readers to syntax-tree queries and show
how they can be used as a computationally cheap approach for
identifying code that handles attacker-controlled input or follows
known bad practices. On the one hand, this article provides a
practical introduction to mining code for patterns in its abstract
syntax trees via a fluent query language. On the other hand, we
discuss the limitations of syntax-tree queries at length.

If you find that the terminology used in this article is foreign to
you, we hope that our [article on Code Property
Graphs](code-property-graph) can help you out.

## What are Abstract Syntax Trees?

Throughout this article, we are using variations of the following
small sample code snippet taken (taken from [this
paper](https://fabs.codeminers.org/papers/2014-ieeesp.pdf)):

```bash
val code = """
void foo () {
  int x = source();
  if(x < MAX) {
	int y = 2*x;
	sink(y);
  }
}
"""
```

The snippet consists of a single function named `foo` without a return
value. It calls a function called `source` on line 2 and stores its
result in an integer called `x`. A subsequent check on line 3
determines whether `x` is smaller than a constant `MAX`, and if so, the
value of `2*x` is stored in y on line 4 and passed as an argument to the
function `sink` on line 5.

We can import this code snippet directly on the Joern shell.


```bash
importCode.c.fromString(code)
```

Once imported, we can plot the abstract syntax tree of `foo` to get a
first idea of what an abstract syntax tree is.

```bash
cpg.method.name("foo").plotDotAst
```

<ImageWithDialog alt="Fig.1: Abstract Syntax Tree for function `foo`. (Click to zoom in)" src={useBaseUrl('img/tree.png')} showAltTextInCaption="true" />

As shown in the sample plot in Figure 1, an abstract syntax tree is a
tree-like structure that makes the decomposition of code into its
language constructs explicit. The tree consists of *nodes* and *edges*
visualized in the plot as ellipses and arrows respectively.

Nodes represent language constructs such as methods, variables, and
control structures, while edges indicate decomposition. For example,
at the very top of the tree, we see a node representing the entire
function `foo`, and directly beneath it, we see a node for the return
type `void` and one for the function body, denoted as a `BLOCK`. The
edges between the function- and the two other nodes indicates that the
function can be decomposed into a return type and a block of code, and
outgoing edges from `BLOCK` show that this block of code can be
further decomposed.

:::note
In the plot, the pair `(type,attribute)` is displayed in each node,
where `type` is the node type and attribute is one of the values
that is particularly indicative for the node, e.g., the method name
for method nodes. We make an exception for calls, where we display the
pair `(name,attribute)`.

## Basic AST Traversals

The most basic [traversal](traversal-basics) that you can
execute on any AST node is `ast`, which traverses to all nodes of the
AST rooted in the node. For example,

```bash
cpg.method("foo").ast.l
```

gives you all AST nodes of the AST for the method `foo`. As each AST
node is also the root of a subtree, you can also think of this
operation as an enumeration of all subtrees. These can be filtered by
type. For example,

```
cpg.method("foo").ast.isCall.code.l
```

gives you all outgoing calls from `foo` while

```
cpg.method("foo").ast.isControlStructure.code.l
```

gives you all control structures. For method nodes, we also offer
shorthands for the most common node types. Using these shorthands, the
two queries can be written as

```
cpg.method("foo").call.code.l
```
and
```
cpg.method("foo).controlStructure.code.l
```
respectively.

It is also possible to walk the tree upwards using `inAst` or
`inAstMinusLeaf` where the latter excludes the start node. In our
running example, consider for example the situation where it is known
that calls to `source` return values that an attacker can
influence.

```bash
cpg.call.name("source").inAstMinusLeaf.isCall.name(".*assignment.*").argument(1).l
```

The query begins by selecting all calls to `source`, encoded in the
graph as nodes of type `CALL` with a string property called `name`
that is set to `"source"`. From there, we walk edges backwards
until we reach the method node using `inAstMinusLeaf`. For the set of
nodes thus collected, we determine only those which are calls
(`isCall`) to the assignment operator `.name(".*assignment.*")`. For
each of these, we determine their first argument, the assignment
target.

As certain operators exist across programming languages and operating
on them via AST-queries is common, we have created a decorator
language to simplify these queries. In practice, we would write the
following query that is equivalent to the former query.

```bash
cpg.call("source").inAssignment.target.l
```

## Control Structures

Abstract syntax trees include control structures such as `if`-,
`while` or `for`-statements. Our example program contains only a
single control structure, namely, the `if`-statement on line 3.

<ImageWithDialog alt="Fig.3: Control structure in the abstract syntax
tree. The subtree on the left represents the condition, the subtree on
the right is the compound statement." src={useBaseUrl('img/ast3.png')} showAltTextInCaption="true" />

Figure 3 shows how `if`-statements are represented in the syntax
tree. The tree consists of two sub trees, one that holds the condition
`x < MAX` and another that holds the statements in the
`if`-block. Conditions can be selected as follows:

```bash
cpg.method("foo").controlStructure.condition.code.l
=> List("x < MAX")
```

The body of the if-statement can be selected using `whenTrue`:

```bash
cpg.method("foo").controlStructure.whenTrue.l
res16: List[AstNode] = List(
  Block(
	id -> 17L,
	code -> "",
	order -> 2,
	argumentIndex -> 2,
	typeFullName -> "void",
	dynamicTypeHintFullName -> List(),
	lineNumber -> Some(5),
	columnNumber -> Some(4),
	depthFirstOrder -> None,
	internalFlags -> None
  )
)
```

For `if-else` constructs, `whenFalse` returns the else block, however,
since no `else` block exists in our example, an empty list is
returned:

```
cpg.method("foo").controlStructure.whenFalse.l
=> List[AstNode] = List()
```

As each of the nodes returned by `.ast` are also roots of syntax
trees, we can identify nested structures by chaining basic
operations.

```
cpg.method("foo").controlStructure.whenTrue.ast.isCall.code.l
=> List[String] = List("y = 2*x", "sink(y)", "2*x")
```

yields all calls nested inside if blocks. You may ask yourself why
`2*x` is returned as a call. The reason is that we model all
invocations of built-in operators as calls to methods with the name
`<operator>.$operatorName`, where $operatorName may for example be
"multiplication", or "assignment".

One example scenario where control structure access comes in handy is
when you wish to determine all methods that call a specific function
but do not include a necessary check. Say, for example, that we want
to identify functions that call `source` but they do not include a
check against `MAX`. The following query achieves this:


```bash
cpg.method.filterNot(_.controlStructure(".*MAX.*"))
		  .filter(_.callee.name(".*source.*")).l
=> List()
```

Note, however, that the query does not specify the oder in which these
statements must occur, e.g., the check may happen too late. Control
flow graphs and dominator trees are the right tools to reason about
statement order. These structures are available in the code property
graph as well, but we do not discuss them in this article.

## Nesting of control structures

Let us modify our example code slightly as follows to obtain a deeper
understanding of what one can and cannot do using the control
structures exposed by abstract syntax trees.

```bash
val code = """
void foo () {
  int x = source();

  if (x > 10) {
	goto end;
  }

  while(x++ < MAX) {
	if(x != 0) {
		int y = 2*x;
		sink(y);
	}
  }

  end:
}
"""
```

Importing and plotting yields the following:

<ImageWithDialog alt="Fig. 4: Abstract syntax tree containing
structured and unstructured control structures"
src={useBaseUrl('img/ast4.png')} showAltTextInCaption="true" />

As we can see in Figure 4, the language formulated so far can be used
easily to describe nested constructs. For example, if we would like to
identify all calls to `sink` nested in an `if`-block that is itself
nested in a `while` block, we could use the following query:

```bash
cpg.call("sink")
	.inAst.filter(_.isControlStructure.code("if.*"))
	.inAst.filter(_.isControlStructure.code("while.*")).l

=> List[AstNode] = List(
  ControlStructure(
	id -> 19L,
	code -> "while(x++ < MAX)",
	columnNumber -> Some(2),
	lineNumber -> Some(9),
	order -> 3,
	parserTypeName -> "WhileStatement",
	argumentIndex -> 3,
	depthFirstOrder -> None,
	internalFlags -> None
  )
)
```

Alternatively, we can walk the tree from its top to achieve the same:

```
 cpg.method
	.controlStructure("while.*")
	.ast.isControlStructure.code("if.*")
	.ast.isCallTo("sink").l

=> List[Call] = List(
  Call(
	id -> 36L,
	code -> "sink(y)",
	name -> "sink",
	order -> 2,
	methodInstFullName -> None,
	methodFullName -> "sink",
	argumentIndex -> 2,
	dispatchType -> "STATIC_DISPATCH",
	signature -> "TODO assignment signature",
	typeFullName -> "ANY",
	dynamicTypeHintFullName -> List(),
	lineNumber -> Some(12),
	columnNumber -> Some(0),
	resolved -> None,
	depthFirstOrder -> None,
	internalFlags -> None
  )
)
```

While the syntax tree is not primarily concerned with exposing control
flow, when a function only contains structured control structures such
as `if` blocks or `while` loops, limited reasoning about control flow
is possible. For example, since the call to `sink` is nested inside
the `if` block and `while` loop, we can be certain that the conditions
introduced by these two control structures are evaluated at least once
before `sink` is called. We can also be certain that a sibling tree to
the left is executed before a tree itself.

This, however, does not work in the face of unstructured control flow
as introduced by `goto`. We make these statements as well as their
jump targets visible in the tree, however, allowing functions where
control flow must be analyzed with control flow graphs can be
determined.
