The Code Property Graph is a data structure designed to mine large
codebases for instances of programming patterns. These patterns are
formulated in a domain-specific language (DSL) based on
[Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/). It serves as a single
intermediate program representation across all languages supported by
Joern and its commercial brother [Ocular](https://www.shifleft.io/).

Property graphs are a generic abstraction supported by many
contemporary graph databases such as [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/),
[OrientDB](https://orientdb.com/), and
[JanusGraph](https://janusgraph.org/). In fact, [older versions of
Joern](https://github.com/fabsx00/joern-old) made use of general
purpose graph databases as a storage backend and the graph query
language [Gremlin](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/gremlin.html). As the
limitations of this approach became more apparent over the years, we
replaced both the storage backend and query language with our own
graph database
[OverflowDB](https://github.com/ShiftLeftSecurity/overflowdb).

ShiftLeft has open-sourced the [implementation of the code property
graph](https://github.com/ShiftLeftSecurity/codepropertygraph) and its
specification.

## Building Blocks of Code Property Graphs

Code Property Graphs are [graphs as studied in discrete
mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)),
and more specifically [property
graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.1001.pdf). A property graph is
composed of the following building blocks:

- **Nodes and their types.** Nodes represent program
  constructs. This includes low-level language constructs such as
  methods, variables, and control structures, but also higher level
  constructs such as HTTP endpoints or findings. Each node has a
  type. The type indicates the type of program construct represented
  by the node, e.g., a node with the type `METHOD` represents a method
  while a node with type `LOCAL` represents the declaration of a local
  variable.

- **Labeled directed edges.**
  Relations between program constructs are represented via edges
  between their corresponding nodes. For example, to express that a
  method contains a local variable, we can create an edge with the
  label `CONTAINS` from the method's node to the local's node. By
  using labeled edges, we can represent multiple types of relations in
  the same graph. Moreover, edges are directed to express, e.g., that
  the method contains the local but not the other way around. Multiple
  edges may exist between the same two nodes.

- **Key-Value Pairs.**
  Nodes carry key-value pairs (attributes), where the valid
  keys depend on the node type. For example, a method has at
  least a name and a signature while a local declaration has at
  least the name and the type of the declared variable.

In summary, Code Property Graphs are directed, edge-labeled,
attributed multigraphs, and we insist that each node carries at least
one attribute that indicates its type.

A Look into the Rear-View Mirror

The Code Property Graph was first introduced in the paper [Modeling
and Discovering Vulnerabilities with Code Property
Graphs](https://fabs.codeminers.org/papers/2014-ieeesp.pdf) in the
context of vulnerability discovery for C system code and the Linux
kernel in particular. The core ideas outlined in this early work are
the following:

* Different classic program representations are merged into a property
  graph into a single data structure that holds information about the
  program’s syntax, control- and intra-procedural data-flow.

* The property graph is stored in a graph database and made accessible
  via a domain specific language (DSL) for the identification of
  programming patterns - based on a DSL for graph traversals.

* The query language allows to seamlessly transition between the
original code representations, making it possible to combine aspects
of the code from different views these representations offer in a
single query.

From 2014-2016, research followed on (a) extending the concept for
interprocedural analysis, (b) using the graph as a basis for learning
typical data-flow patterns in a program, (c) the effects of
introducing further classic program representations such as dominator
trees, (d) and the applicability of the approach for dynamically-typed
languages such as PHP.

From 2017 onwards, the code property graph served as the technological
foundation for the static analysis solutions developed at ShiftLeft
Inc. The representation has since undergone heavy extensions and
transformations. At the statement and expression level, it has matured
into a generic container format which allows for hosting of graphs
generated by 8 different language frontends, to enable querying with
the same query language across programming languages. Moreover, the
concept of overlays was introduced to allow representing code
on different levels of abstraction, enabling transitioning
between these layers of abstraction using the query language in the
same way as for the original three low-level code
representations. Finally, programming models and APIs are now
available for parallel graph processing at low memory footprint - a
core ingredient for scaling the approach.
